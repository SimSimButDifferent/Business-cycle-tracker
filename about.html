            <div class="card-body">
              <p>
                The business cycle refers to the fluctuations in economic
                activity that an economy experiences over time. It consists of
                alternating periods of expansion and contraction in real GDP,
                which includes:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Expansion</strong>: Increasing economic activity,
                  growth in production, employment, and income.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Peak</strong>: The highest point of economic activity
                  before a contraction begins.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Contraction</strong>: Decreasing economic activity,
                  with possible recession indicators.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Trough</strong>: The lowest point of economic activity
                  before recovery starts.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Business cycles typically last 5-10 years, but can vary
                significantly in length and intensity.

              <h5>Leading Economic Indicators</h5>
            </div>
            <div class="card-body">
              <p>
                Leading economic indicators are metrics that tend to change
                before the overall economy changes, providing insights into
                future economic activity. This dashboard focuses on several key
                indicators:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Global M2 Money Supply</strong>: A measure of money
                  circulating in the global economy, including cash, checking
                  deposits, and easily convertible near-money. Changes in M2 can
                  be a leading indicator for market movements, with research
                  suggesting a 10-week lead time for assets like the NASDAQ and
                  Bitcoin.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>ISM Manufacturing PMI</strong>: A monthly indicator of
                  economic activity in the manufacturing sector. Values above 50
                  indicate expansion, while below 50 indicate contraction.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>ISM Services PMI</strong>: Similar to the
                  manufacturing index but focusing on the services sector, which
                  makes up a significant portion of developed economies.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>

              <h5>The Exponential Age Thesis</h5>
            </div>
            <div class="card-body">
              <p>
                The Exponential Age thesis, popularized by financial analyst
                Raoul Pal, posits that we are entering an era characterized by
                the rapid adoption of exponential technologies (like artificial
                intelligence, crypto currencies, and renewable energy) that will
                fundamentally reshape markets and the global economy.
              </p>
              <p>
                Key insights from this thesis that inform our dashboard include:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Global liquidity (M2 money supply) acts as a powerful leading
                  indicator for risk asset prices.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Traditional business cycle indicators still provide important
                  context even as technology changes the nature of economic
                  growth.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Assets like Bitcoin may show heightened sensitivity to changes
                  in global liquidity conditions compared to traditional
                  markets.
                </li>
